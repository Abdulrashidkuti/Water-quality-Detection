 Water quality remains a critical component of public health, environmental safety, and sustainable
 development. Traditional methods of assessing potability are often time-consuming, expensive, and
 limited in scalability. This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict
 water potability using a dataset of 3,276 instances with 10 physicochemical parameters, including pH,
 hardness, solids, and turbidity. Missing values were handled using the median imputation method, and
 outliers were treated using the Interquartile Range (IQR) technique, resulting in the removal of 610
 anomalies. Multiple classification models—including Decision Tree, Support Vector Classifier, K
Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest—were evaluated to determine the best performing approach.
 The Random Forest Classifier demonstrated superior performance, achieving a training accuracy of
 100% and a testing accuracy of 66%. An interactive user interface was developed using Tkinter to allow
 users to input water quality parameters and receive real-time potability predictions. Additionally, model
 performance was assessed through visualizations such as correlation matrices and accuracy
 comparison graphs. This study demonstrates that machine learning can provide a reliable, scalable, and
 cost-effective alternative to conventional water testing methods, supporting early decision-making and
 improving water resource management. The project also provides a foundation for future improvements
 using ensemble learning, feature optimization, and real-time data integration.
